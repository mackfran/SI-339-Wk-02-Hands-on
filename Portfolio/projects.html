			<h2>Senior Year Capstone</h2>
			<p>For my SI 485 capstone project, my group was assigned to work with PlayFlu, a startup with headquarters in Ann Arbor. PlayFlu was created with funds from the National Science Foundation as a program for teaching life sciences in the context of public health. The program travels to various schools and uses wearable technology to manage a tag-style game that models how viruses, specifically the flu, spread. Students are assigned a health status of either healthy, sick, or vaccinated, which determines their role in the game. The wearable devices collect data about students' demographics, kinesthetic activity, points accrued, in-game interactions, and scores on pre and post-workshop assessments.<br></br>The goal of my capstone project was to maximize the educational value of PlayFlu for students by enabling more efficient analysis for future research and development efforts, offering ways to optimize the presentation of data, and generating valuable insights. Take a look at our poster from the UMSI expoSItion (below) to learn more about our methods and findings!</p>

			<h2>Data Exploration Project</h2>
			<p>For my final project is SI 370, I utilized a “Social Power NBA” dataset from Kaggle. I thought it would be interesting to explore how social media impacts the value of NBA players and their teams, as well as whether or not popularity on social media is correlated with court performance. The amount of data in these csv files also allowed me to explore how the skill levels of individual players impact the overall value of their teams, as well as how the distribution of certain team statistics varies between the Eastern and Western conferences.</p>
			<p>The scatterplot I generated (bottom left) displays a weak, positive correlation between a player’s popularity on social media and their salary. However, this correlation isn’t very strong because there are a fair number of players with a low number of total engagements who have salaries just as high as the players with the highest numbers of total engagements. This could be attributed to a lack of presence on social media. Therefore, this scatterplot shows that players with greater social power generally have above-average salaries, but social power isn’t a prerequisite for high worth.</p>
			<p>This packed bubbles graph I generated (bottom right) in Tableau shows that teams with a greater combined player social power aren’t always more valuable. The Golden State Warriors clearly have the highest combined player social power, but the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers are clearly more valuable. The Cleveland Cavaliers have the second greatest combined player social power, but the value of their team falls on the lower end of the spectrum. Although there are noticeable anomalies, the teams represented by smaller bubbles, the ones with lower combined social power, are usually less valuable than the teams represented by the larger bubbles. This is likely because teams with players who are popular in the media bring more fans to games and generate more revenue for their respective teams than players who are less popular.</p>

			<h2 id="manipulation">Data Manipulation Project</h2>
			<p>I was curious about what the best movies from 2016 had in common. To figure this out, I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the “Top 100 Movies of 2016” page from 2016. I then inputted the titles of these movies into the OMDb API to retrieve each of the movies’ plot summaries. I chose to utilize plot summaries because they often outline the themes and topics present in the movie they describe. From there, I wrote code that determined the most common words across all of these plot summaries.<br></br>This visualization (below) shows that the most common word, with a frequency of 33, was “life”. Next came “world” with a frequency of 24 and “new” with a frequency of 22. What I found particularly interesting about these results was that a lot of the common words were human-centric, such as “man”, “family”, “people”, “love”, and “story”.</p>

			<p>Once a month, UMSocial hosts a #UMichChat featuring a panel of experts discussing a topic relevant to the University of Michigan community. These discussions take place on Facebook Live, Twitter, or Snapchat. In addition to generating topic ideas, securing panelists, and executing the chat, I'm responsible for writing a recap summarizing what the panelists talked about and how the chat performed on social.<br></br>Click <a href="http://socialmedia.umich.edu/blog/the-next-american-classic-literature-film-and-theatre-in-the-21st-century-umichchat-recap/">here</a> to read a recap of a recent #UMichChat discussing which works from literature, film, and theater in the 21st century have the potential to become classics, or watch the entire livestream here:</p>

			<h2 id="spotify">University Spotify Strategy</h2>
			<p>As an intern for UMSocial, I was given the opportunity to take on a "passion project". When I started as an intern, they already had a presence on Spotify, but I had a lot of ideas as to how UMSocial could improve their strategy to increase engagement on the platform. After formalizing these ideas and creating an implementation plan, I gave a presentation to the 60+ members of social leadership from around campus. In addition to explaining the new strategy, I had to convince them why they should care about Spotify in the first place. Below are a few of my slides from that presentation:</p>

			<h2 id="recap">Monthly Analytics</h2>
			<p>At the end of each month, I'm responsible for collecting and recording social media metrics for UMSocial. I download platform-based analytics from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and extract valuable insights that can be used to better inform strategy. Previously, I wrote monthly recaps that summarized UMSocial's best-performing and creative content from each month, but those have since been transformed into weekly recaps. Below are some of the Facebook metrics collected in the first quarter of 2017:</p>
